    "strategy_name": "Exam-Oriented Keypoint Extraction Strategy",
    "approach": "This strategy prioritizes extracting keypoints from exam-related documents first, as they directly reflect assessment content and expected student knowledge. The extraction method involves scanning high-priority files for repeated or emphasized concepts, formulas, and terminology, especially those appearing in both exams and their answer keys. For topic-based chapters, key concepts and formulas are extracted with a focus on definitions, economic intuition, and empirical relevance. The content is chunked into logical sections of at least 8000 characters to ensure comprehensive context while avoiding redundancy. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are used to identify named entities, formula patterns, and question-answer patterns to determine考点. Duplicate or highly similar keypoints across files are merged to ensure uniqueness and clarity.",
    "reasoning": "The document structure is mixed, with both topic-based chapters and exam/assessment-based files. Since the user's primary goal is to extract important考点 with a focus on exams, the strategy begins with exam files to identify frequently tested content. Answer keys are placed immediately after their corresponding exams to cross-reference and validate考点. Topic-based chapters are then processed in order, focusing on core financial theories and models such as CAPM, EMH, and anomalies. The presence of formulas requires careful parsing to ensure mathematical expressions are captured accurately. Chunk size is set to at least 8000 characters to maintain context while enabling efficient processing. Emphasis is placed on avoiding repetition by comparing extracted keypoints across related chapters and exams, especially for topics like liquidity that span multiple files. The extraction approach aligns with the complexity and theoretical nature of the content, ensuring clarity and relevance for exam preparation.",

        "description": "Alpha (α) measures abnormal return after accounting for systematic risk. In CAPM, a positive alpha suggests outperformance or mispricing, but in multifactor models like Fama-French or ICAPM, alpha may become insignificant, indicating fair compensation for exposure to risk factors such as value, momentum, or macroeconomic variables. In zero-investment portfolios, alpha must be interpreted without subtracting the risk-free rate. A portfolio with positive CAPM alpha and a positive correlation with GDP growth is riskier under ICAPM, as it performs poorly during economic downturns. If an anomaly shows zero alpha under the Fama-French model, its explanation depends on whether SMB and HML are viewed as risk factors (ICAPM), APT factors, or themselves anomalies. This distinction is critical in determining whether the anomaly reflects risk, mispricing, or is a repackaged version of existing effects.",

        "description": "Liquidity risk refers to the uncertainty investors face regarding future transaction costs when selling an asset. It introduces additional volatility to asset prices and is priced into expected returns in models like the Liquidity-Adjusted CAPM (LCAPM). Liquidity is measured using proxies such as the Roll measure, Amihud measure, Kyle’s lambda, and ILLIQ. Empirical studies show that liquidity risk is priced, with higher sensitivity to market-wide liquidity shocks leading to higher expected returns (Pastor and Stambaugh, 2003). Acharya and Pedersen (2005) extend this by modeling expected excess returns as a function of both expected illiquidity and four liquidity-related betas. In fixed income, the liquidity of U.S. Treasury securities affects their yield to maturity, with more liquid instruments like bills commanding lower yields than less liquid notes (Amihud and Mendelson, 1991a; Kamara, 1994; Longstaff, 2004). In closed-end funds, liquidity differences between the fund and its underlying assets determine the premium or discount to NAV (Datar, 2001; Manzler, 2004). Securities lending and trading costs also influence the pricing of equities and derivatives (Duffie et al., 2002). Transaction costs reduce the effectiveness of trading strategies and limit arbitrage opportunities (Balduzzi and Lynch, 1999).",

These measures are used in empirical studies to assess trading costs, market impact, and liquidity risk. Momentum strategies, as defined by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), involve sorting stocks monthly on past six-month returns, buying top 10% (winners), shorting bottom 10% (losers), and holding for six months (6-0-6 strategy). The return is the average of six overlapping portfolios. Earnings momentum is constructed using year-on-year earnings growth cutoffs, which are stable across time and percentiles: 10th (-160% to -180%), 25th (-75% to -100%), 75th (+30% to +40%), and 90th (+140% to +165%). Earnings momentum is more concentrated around earnings announcements than price momentum, which has implications for strategy timing.",

Acharya and Pedersen (2005) extend this by modeling expected excess returns as a function of both expected illiquidity and four liquidity-related betas: traditional beta, β^L1, β^L2, β^L3.

In CAPM, a positive alpha suggests outperformance or mispricing, but in multifactor models like Fama-French or ICAPM, alpha may become insignificant, indicating fair compensation for exposure to risk factors such as value, momentum, or macroeconomic variables. In zero-investment portfolios, alpha must be interpreted without subtracting the risk-free rate. A portfolio with positive CAPM alpha and a positive correlation with GDP growth is riskier under ICAPM, as it performs poorly during economic downturns. If an anomaly shows zero alpha under the Fama-French model, its explanation depends on whether SMB and HML are viewed as risk factors (ICAPM), APT factors, or themselves anomalies.

It introduces additional volatility to asset prices and is priced into expected returns in models like the Liquidity-Adjusted CAPM (LCAPM). Liquidity is measured using proxies such as the Roll measure, Amihud measure, Kyle’s lambda, and ILLIQ. Empirical studies show that liquidity risk is priced, with higher sensitivity to market-wide liquidity shocks leading to higher expected returns (Pastor and Stambaugh, 2003). Acharya and Pedersen (2005) extend this by modeling expected excess returns as a function of both expected illiquidity and four liquidity-related betas. In fixed income, the liquidity of U.S. Treasury securities affects their yield to maturity, with more liquid instruments like bills commanding lower yields than less liquid notes (Amihud and Mendelson, 1991a; Kamara, 1994; Longstaff, 2004). In closed-end funds, liquidity differences between the fund and its underlying assets determine the premium or discount to NAV (Datar, 2001; Manzler, 2004). Securities lending and trading costs also influence the pricing of equities and derivatives (Duffie et al., 2002). Transaction costs reduce the effectiveness of trading strategies and limit arbitrage opportunities (Balduzzi and Lynch, 1999).",
