    "strategy_name": "Exam-Oriented Keypoint Extraction Strategy",
    "approach": "This strategy prioritizes extracting keypoints from exam-related documents first, as they directly reflect assessment content and expected student knowledge. The extraction method involves scanning high-priority files for repeated or emphasized concepts, formulas, and terminology, especially those appearing in both exams and their answer keys. For topic-based chapters, key concepts and formulas are extracted with a focus on definitions, economic intuition, and empirical relevance. The content is chunked into logical sections of at least 8000 characters to ensure comprehensive context while avoiding redundancy. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are used to identify named entities, formula patterns, and question-answer patterns to determine考点. Duplicate or highly similar keypoints across files are merged to ensure uniqueness and clarity.",

    "reasoning": "The document structure is mixed, with both topic-based chapters and exam/assessment-based files. Since the user's primary goal is to extract important考点 with a focus on exams, the strategy begins with exam files to identify frequently tested content. Answer keys are placed immediately after their corresponding exams to cross-reference and validate考点. Topic-based chapters are then processed in order, focusing on core financial theories and models such as CAPM, EMH, and anomalies. The presence of formulas requires careful parsing to ensure mathematical expressions are captured accurately. Chunk size is set to at least 8000 characters to maintain context while enabling efficient processing. Emphasis is placed on avoiding repetition by comparing extracted keypoints across related chapters and exams, especially for topics like liquidity that span multiple files. The extraction approach aligns with the complexity and theoretical nature of the content, ensuring clarity and relevance for exam preparation."
