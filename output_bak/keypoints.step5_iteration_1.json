      "topic": "CAPM Expected Return Formula",
      "description": "The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) formula states that the expected return of an asset is equal to the risk-free rate plus beta times the market risk premium: $ E(R_t) = RF_t + \beta \\cdot (E(MKT_t) - RF_t) $. This equation captures the risk-return tradeoff in asset pricing.",
      "importance": 5,
      "importance_reason": "This is the foundational formula of the CAPM, a core concept in finance and a frequent topic in exams. It explains how expected returns are determined by risk exposure relative to the market.",

      "importance_reason": "Alpha is a critical diagnostic in asset pricing regressions. It is often tested in empirical finance exams to evaluate whether a stock or portfolio generates abnormal returns.",
